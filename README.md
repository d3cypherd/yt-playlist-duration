# ðŸ•’ YouTube Playlist Duration Calculator

This Python script calculates the total duration of a YouTube playlist and shows how long it would take to watch at different playback speeds (1x, 1.25x, 1.5x, 1.75x, 2x).

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Retrieves playlist metadata using `yt-dlp`
- Displays duration of each video (with fallback for unknown durations)
- Calculates total playlist time at various playback speeds
- Allows selection of a subset of the playlist by index range

## ðŸš€ Usage

```bash
python app.py <playlist_url> <start_index> <end_index>
```

- `playlist_url`: Link to the YouTube playlist
- `start_index`: First video index (1-based)
- `end_index`: Last video index (inclusive)

### Example
```bash
python app.py https://youtube.com/playlist?list=XYZ 1 10
```

This will analyze videos 1 through 10 in the playlist.
